= Running Cypher fragments

We can use Cypher as safe, graph-aware, partially compiled scripting language within APOC.

== Example: Fast Node-Counts by Label

Counts by label are quickly provided by the counts-store, but only if they are the the single thing in the query, like

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*);
----

It also works to combine several with `UNION ALL`, but not via `WITH`

.Doesn't work
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) WITH count(*) as people
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN people, count(*) as movies;
----

.Works
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*)
UNION ALL
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN count(*);
----


But with `apoc.cypher.run` we can construct the statement and run each of them individually, so it completes in a few ms.

[source,cypher]
----
call db.labels() yield label
call apoc.cypher.run("match (:`"+label+"`) return count(*) as count", null) yield value
return label, value.count as count
----

You can use a similar approach to get the property-keys per label:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.labels() yield label
call apoc.cypher.run("MATCH (n:`"+label+"`) RETURN keys(n) as keys LIMIT 1",null) yield value
RETURN label, value.keys as keys
----


== running a cypher statement timeboxed

There's a way to terminate a cypher statement if it takes longer than a given threshold. Consider an expensive statement calculating cross product of shortestpaths for each pair of nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed("match (n),(m) match p=shortestPath((n)-[*]-(m)) return p", null, 10000) yield value
return value.p
----
