= Graph Refactoring Procedures

These procedures help refactor the structure of your graph.
This is helpful when you need to change your data model or for cleaning up data that was imported from an external source.

== Normalize boolean properties

Given raw data boolean properties are often represented by placeholder values.
This procedure turns them into boolean properties.

Will be true if "Y", YES"; false if "N", "NO"; null otherwise:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(n, "prop", ["Y", "YES"], ["N", NO"])
RETURN n.prop
----

== Categorization

Categorize replaces string property values on nodes with relationship to a unique category node for that property value.

This example will turn all n.color properties into :HAS_ATTRIBUTE relationships to :Color nodes with a matching .colour property.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.refactor.categorize('color','HAS_ATTRIBUTE',true,'Color','colour',['popularity'],1)
----

Additionally, it will also copy over the first 'popularity' property value encountered on any node n for each newly created :Color node and remove any occurrences of that property value on nodes with the same 'Color'.

= Using Cypher and APOC to move a property value to a label

You can use the procedure link:#_creating_data[`apoc.create.addLabels`] to move a property to a label with Cypher as follows

.Create a node with property studio
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'A Few Good Men', genre: 'Drama'})
----

.Move the 'genre' property to a label and remove it as a property
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie) 
CALL apoc.create.addLabels( id(n), [ n.genre ] ) YIELD node 
REMOVE node.studio
RETURN node
----
